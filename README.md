# DF-Assignment
Final Assignment to create and solve a case for 'Digital Forensics' Module Taken in NP Semester 4.

# What was Required
I, alongside with one of my peer, had to research on existing open source digital forensic tools to solve a case. This case is meant to be created by us and we could be as creative as possible. After deciding the case, we have to use the tools we researched on to find evidences in the case to point out the attacker and victim. There is also a poster that is supposed to be created based on the tools we used. Lastly, there was also in-class activity where we had to use the software, Encase, to find evidence in a case given to us. Unfortunately, the details about case is no longer available but the examiner report my team mate and I created has been uploaded. 

# My Duties
I assisted in creating the case scenario, assisted in creating the evidence such as making fake emails for the case. I also researched on the tools, Voltality and steghide to help solve the case.
